# Textual_Extras


This is a hobby projects where I am building some usable widgets that could come in handy \
when building projects with textual (This project will most likely never merge in the original repo)


There is a repo that does the same kind of thing for inputs named - [textual_inputs](https://github.com/sirfuzzalot/textual-inputs) but... \
there were so many things i wanted to modify... so I created my own little library

> ⚠️ ***NOTE:*** Textual is going under rapid development and some things, at some point of time, might break.. \
> so PRs are more than welcome :)

## What is Textual?
[Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) is a TUI (Text User Interface) framework for Python inspired by modern web development.

## Emits

**TextChanged** => Emitted when the text in the input area is changed \
**PyperclipError** =>  Emitted when there is a problem when pasting text from system clipboard (see [Some caveats](#some-caveats)) \
**InvalidInputAttempt** => Emitted when there is an attempt to input a letter ***which is in blacklist or not in the whitelist***

------------------

## Some caveats

> ⚠️ ***NOTE:*** There is no implementation for ctrl+backspace as backspace is represented as ctrl+h in textual and ctrl+ctrl+h, is unfortunately, not a thing :(

> ⚠️ ***NOTE:*** **ctrl+v** should work just fine on windows and mac.. On linux if you are on X11 system.. consider adding `xclip` for this feature \
**On Ubuntu :** sudo apt install xclip \
**On ArchLinux :** well you should know it already if you use Arch.. I use Arch btw :)
