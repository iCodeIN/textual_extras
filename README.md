# Textual-Extras


This is a hobby projects where I am building some usable widgets that could come in handy \
when building projects with textual (This project will most likely never merge in the original repo)


There is a repo that does the same kind of thing for inputs named - [textual_inputs](https://github.com/sirfuzzalot/textual-inputs) but... \
there were so many things i wanted to modify... so I created my own little library


## What is Textual?
[Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) is a TUI (Text User Interface) framework for Python inspired by modern web development. Currently a Work in Progress.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è ***NOTE:*** Textual is going under rapid development and some things, at some point of time, might break.. \
> so PRs are more than welcome :)
